/**
 * `POST /webhooks/crowdsource` — where decisions come back.
 *
 * ## The mount is part of the correctness
 *
 * This router MUST be mounted before `express.json()` in `index.ts`. The signature
 * covers `timestamp + "." + rawBody` — the bytes that arrived — and once a JSON
 * parser has run, those bytes are gone.
 *
 * Syra's parser happens to keep a Buffer copy on `req.rawBody`, which
 * `@oxyhq/crowdsource-express` would accept, so mounting late would appear to work
 * — and that is exactly why the guard below exists rather than a comment. The
 * `verify` hook that populates `req.rawBody` is there for the provider HMAC and
 * belongs to another feature entirely; the day somebody removes or narrows it,
 * webhook verification would start signing over a re-serialisation with nothing
 * failing. Reading the stream ourselves depends on nothing.
 *
 * ## What this handler does and does not do
 *
 * It records and returns. §10.8 asks a receiver to answer 2xx quickly and queue
 * the processing, and the reason is not latency: applying a decision means reading
 * catalog rows, planning enforcement and writing several collections, and a
 * receiver that did all that inline would time out under a burst and be retried
 * while the first attempt was still running. So the event and a durable
 * `decision.apply` outbox row commit in ONE transaction, and the dispatcher does
 * the work.
 *
 * Nothing here is authenticated by Oxy. The HMAC IS the authentication (§10.8),
 * and an Oxy session must never satisfy this route — it is not a user endpoint.
 */

/**
 * Refuses to run if a body parser got here first.
 *
 * The invariant this protects is a MOUNT ORDER, which no type can express and no
 * unit test of this file alone would notice. Answering 500 rather than falling
 * back is the point: a receiver that verified a signature over bytes it
 * reconstructed would be worse than one that plainly refuses, because it would
 * keep accepting deliveries and nobody would ever look.
