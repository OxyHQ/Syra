/**
 * Turning a stored report into the thing the SDK delivers.
 *
 * What this module produces is the SDK's `ReportInput` — a description of the
 * material — and the SDK derives the envelope from it: resource ids, relations,
 * digests, pseudonymous principal refs, the identity binding proof, the pinned
 * policy version, the privacy terms and the idempotency key.
 *
 * That is not a technicality. Those derived values are exactly what §7.3's dedup
 * key is computed over, so an application that composed its own envelope would be
 * the reason two reporters about one agent opened two cases — and "one penalty per
 * incident" would fail in production with nothing failing in a test. Building the
 * description and letting the SDK build the document is what keeps that property
 * true for every application at once.
 *
 * So this module does three things and no more: ask the registry for a snapshot of
 * the reported object, translate the reporter's categories into allegations, and
 * assemble both with the report's own identity.
 *
 * **Nothing composed here may vary between two deliveries of the same report.**
 * Ingress fingerprints the whole envelope to detect §10.5's payload conflict, so
 * an invented timestamp, a random id or an unsorted list turns a legitimate outbox
 * retry into a permanent 409 — silently, days later, as a report stuck in a queue.
 * Hence `submittedAt` is the report's own `createdAt`, allegation codes are sorted,
 * and category metadata is sorted before it is joined.
 */

/**
 * The material could not be described, because nothing can describe it.
 *
 * This is a DEFECT, not a state, and it should be unreachable. A report whose type
 * has no subject provider never gets a delivery event in the first place — intake
 * decides that from the same registry this module reads — so an event that arrives
 * here has been created by something that bypassed intake, or by a deployment
 * where a provider was removed while its reports were still in flight.
 *
 * `retryable: false` therefore dead-letters the outbox event so a human looks. The
 * alternative — writing a local state — would file a genuine defect in the one
 * place that looks identical to the deliberate local-only reports, where nothing
 * would ever alert on it.
 *
 * Separate from "the object is gone": a deleted object is a fact about the world
 * and closes the report normally.
