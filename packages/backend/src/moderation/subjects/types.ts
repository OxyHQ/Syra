/**
 * The seam that makes this integration copyable.
 *
 * CrowdSource's side of the "don't design moderation around your own nouns"
 * problem is already solved — the Case Envelope knows nothing about an agent, a
 * post or a listing, and `@oxyhq/crowdsource` composes one from a description of
 * the material. What is left for an application is a translation problem, and this
 * file is the whole of it:
 *
 *     "given one of MY nouns and its id, describe the material"
 *
 * Everything downstream — resource ids, relations, digests, pseudonymous principal
 * refs, the identity binding proof, the pinned policy version, privacy terms, the
 * idempotency key, the envelope itself — is composed by the SDK from that
 * description and is IDENTICAL for every application and every subject type. So
 * adding a subject type is one file implementing {@link ModerationSubjectProvider}
 * plus one line in the registry; nothing in the outbox, the delivery worker, the
 * webhook receiver, the decision worker or the enforcement service changes.
 *
 * Two rules keep it that way, and both are load-bearing rather than stylistic:
 *
 * 1. **A provider returns a DESCRIPTION, never an envelope.** The types below are
 *    the SDK's own input types, re-exported unchanged. A provider that built an
 *    envelope would have to invent resource ids and principal refs, and §7.3's
 *    dedup key is computed over exactly those — two reporters describing one agent
 *    would open two cases, and "one penalty per incident" would fail in production
 *    with nothing failing in a test.
 * 2. **A provider is pure translation with reads.** It fetches its own object and
 *    returns; it does not decide whether to deliver, what the allegation is, or
 *    what happens to the report. Those belong to callers that are shared.
