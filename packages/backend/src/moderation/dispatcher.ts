/**
 * The loop that drains the moderation outbox.
 *
 * A bounded interval, one batch in flight at a time, and an abort signal that
 * stops claiming new work but lets the event already being handled reach a durable
 * state.
 *
 * It is NOT leader-gated, and that is a property of the claim rather than an
 * oversight. Every event is taken under a lease with an owner check, so N tasks
 * draining the same collection simply share the work — and a task dying
 * mid-delivery has its lease expire and its event reclaimed, which a single leader
 * would not give us.
 *
 * `CROWDSOURCE_ENABLED` gates the LOOP, never the durable record. Reports taken
 * while the integration is off keep their outbox rows and deliver when it is
 * switched on; running the loop instead would count attempts against a deployment
 * that has nowhere to send anything and dead-letter the backlog it was supposed to
 * preserve.
