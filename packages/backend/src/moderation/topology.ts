 * Multi-document transactions require a replica set or a sharded cluster.
 *
 * Syra used no transactions at all before this feature, so nothing else in the
 * application would ever notice a standalone `mongod`. It accepts every other
 * write Syra makes and then fails the FIRST time a report and its outbox event try
 * to commit together — which is the moment the outbox stops being able to protect
 * anything.
 *
 * That failure is expensive to diagnose later and free to detect now, so the
 * topology is checked when the integration is switched on rather than discovered
 * at the first report. Mirrors CrowdSource's own `utils/mongoTopology.ts`, which
 * cannot be imported here — its backend is a private package.
