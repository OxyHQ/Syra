/**
 * Delivering a stored report to CrowdSource.
 *
 * Everything hard about this is handled elsewhere and the shape of this file is
 * what is left over: the SDK owns the envelope, the idempotency key, the timeouts,
 * the per-attempt retries and the classification of failures; the outbox owns
 * durability, backoff and dead-lettering. What remains is to describe the
 * material, hand it over, and write down what came back.
 *
 * The failures are as important as the success:
 *
 * - **Nowhere to send it.** The integration is not configured. The event stays
 *   pending, untouched, and delivers when it is — a delay, never a loss.
 * - **The object is gone, or is not somebody's published work.** Deleted between
 *   the report and its delivery, or a built-in skill. There is nothing for a jury
 *   to review, so the report closes locally instead of retrying for days.
 * - **The type has no provider.** Unreachable by design — such a report never gets
 *   a delivery event — so an event that reaches it is a defect and is dead-lettered
 *   rather than retried or filed as a state.
 * - **Anything else** is the SDK's `retryable` to answer, and the outbox obeys it.
