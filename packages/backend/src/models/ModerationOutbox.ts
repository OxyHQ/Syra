 * CrowdSource — so the user never waits for a third party to be reachable, and no
 * report is ever answered "received" with nothing that will send it.
 *
 * The same shape carries work in the other direction: a decision arriving over a
 * webhook is answered 2xx as soon as it is recorded here (§10.8) and applied
 * afterwards. **Nothing is enqueued that is not already written down.** If the
 * dispatcher, the process or the whole task disappears, every pending piece of
 * moderation work is re-derivable by reading this collection.

 * different body") or a rejected envelope cannot, so retrying forever would hide a
 * defect behind an ever-growing attempt count. Those events stop, keep their
