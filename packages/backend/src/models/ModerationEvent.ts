 * Every webhook event CrowdSource has delivered, and what became of it.

 * Two jobs in one collection, and both need it to be durable.
 *
 * **Deduplication.** `_id` is the event id and the index on it is unique, so
 * inserting the row IS the claim — the duplicate-key error is the answer
 * "somebody else already has this event", not a failure to work around. Syra runs
 * several ECS tasks behind one ALB, so the SDK's in-process default store would
 * deduplicate only the instance that happened to receive both copies of a
 * redelivery.
 *
 * **Audit.** "Did CrowdSource tell us about this case, and when" is the first
 * question asked when a report looks stuck, so an event carrying nothing to do is
 * still recorded rather than dropped.
