## About

**Syra** is a modern music streaming platform inspired by Spotify, designed for mobile and web. It features music library management, playlists, artist pages, album browsing, search, and more. Built with Expo, React Native, and a Node.js backend in a modern monorepo structure, it supports file-based routing and a beautiful Spotify-like UI.

## Audius Catalog And Playback

Syra treats Audius as a catalog/source integration, not as a blanket direct-streaming dependency.

- `AUDIUS_CATALOG_ENABLED=true` controls whether Audius catalog content can be shown globally.
- Copyable Audius music should be ingested into Syra storage and served from Syra HLS/audio endpoints.
- `directAudiusStreaming` is a user opt-in fallback only for Audius tracks that cannot be copied/rehosted and only have a provider `streamUrl`.
- Audius tracks with ready Syra HLS must remain visible and playable when direct Audius streaming is disabled.
- Direct-only Audius tracks are hidden from track lists/search/recommendations unless the signed-in user enabled direct Audius streaming.
- Albums, artists, playlists, genre cards, and browse/search containers follow the same playable-track policy. Syra should not present a music container as playable when it has zero tracks for the current user's Audius playback preference.
- Frontend catalog calls that can vary by identity or playback preference use the linked Oxy API client in `packages/frontend/utils/api.ts`, not an anonymous HTTP client.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and bun 1.3+
- MongoDB instance
- Expo CLI for mobile development

### Initial Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OxyHQ/Syra.git
   cd Syra
   ```

2. **Install all dependencies**
   ```bash
   bun run install:all
   ```

### Development

#### Start All Services
```bash
bun run dev
```

#### Start Individual Services
```bash
# Frontend only
bun run dev:frontend

# Backend only
bun run dev:backend
```

#### Frontend Development
The frontend is an Expo React Native app that can run on:
- **Web**: `bun run web` (or `bun run dev:frontend` then press 'w')
- **iOS**: `bun run ios` (requires macOS and Xcode)
- **Android**: `bun run android` (requires Android Studio)

#### Backend Development
The backend runs on the development server with hot reload:
```bash
bun run dev:backend
```
